# Roomiez

Roomiez is a social networking app that allows users to find roommates and apartments. As a roommate, the user will be able to find other roommates and apartments relevant to him or her. As a landlord, the user will have a way to communicate easily with their tenants and a efficient way to rent their apartment.

## Getting Started

The current version of Roomiez is under development. We are currently working to improve the app and to realease it online.

## Founders

German Ostaszynski and Sabra Meretab
